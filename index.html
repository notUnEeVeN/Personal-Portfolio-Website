                <p>Hello! My name is Tybalt Mallet, I am 22 years old, and was born in Grasse, France, and moved to the United States when I was only 5 years old, so I speak both English and French fluently.<br> <br>
                    I am currently a student at College of Marin, studying computer science. I am still in school (only my first year in fact) because during my senior year of high school, I became a professional esports player, and decided to pursue that full time for a few years after I graduated before starting my college education.<br> <br>
                    I also want to study coding and computer science independantly of school to try and do my best to excel in this competitive field, so I am currently enrolled  in the UC Berkeley extension school coding bootcamp, and this webpage my first project made from scratch!</p>
