# Tybalt Mallet's Personal Portfolio Module 2

## Description
This is the Module 2 challenge for the second week of the UCB Coding Bootcamp. For this challenge we were asked to create a website from scratch with no starter code, that would display information and pictures of both me, and the projects I have done/will do in the future. The website features clickable nav bar elements that smooth scroll to the desired sections, as well as functional links to the github repositories/deployed links of all the projects in my portfolio.

## Usage 

This can be used as a way to advertise myself to potential employers, by showing off my knowledge of CSS, HTML, and design through the website itself, and also the future projects that I will put on the website once my project portfolio grows. I can also use this in the future to look back at how to structure and format the complicated CSS and HTML elements that I used, and of course, the actual process of making the website has greatly improved my skills in CSS and HTML overall.
